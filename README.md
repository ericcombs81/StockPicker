# StockPicker
This was a Deep Learning project from college.  I coded a stock picker.

This algorithm reads in the S&P 500.  It predicts if each stock will go up or down the following day.  It takes the ones predicted to go up, and then predicts by how much.  It then uses a risk formula and inputed portfolio amound and then calculates the best stock picks for the next day with the least amount of risk.

This was created in Microsoft Colab.  It works very well....I haven't been wrong with it yet.  PROBLEM: it takes FOREVER to run.  Like several days on even a good computer.  You have to rent the best processors that you can from Google, and it still takes 8 hours ($8) to run a single cycle.  I am waiting a couple of years for the technology to catch up with my algorithm so that I can run it on a home computer in an evening.
